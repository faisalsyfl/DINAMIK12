# update require('../../config.php'); - remove one ../
# update all others includes and requires
# update all links to report pages by removing /course/ part
# update all language strings (use 'report_yourplugin' instead of 'coursereport_yourplugin') - use AMOS hints in commit message
# update all capability names
# grep the plugin codebase and look for any remaining 'coursereport' occurrences
# add new navigation hooks in lib.php - ex: report_stats_extend_navigation_course(), report_stats_extend_navigation_user()
