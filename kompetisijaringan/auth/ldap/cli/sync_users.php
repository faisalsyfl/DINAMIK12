/**
 * CAS user sync script.
 *
 * This script is meant to be called from a cronjob to sync moodle with the LDAP
 * backend in those setups where the LDAP backend acts as 'master'.
 *
 * Sample cron entry:
 * # 5 minutes past 4am
 * 5 4 * * * $sudo -u www-data /usr/bin/php /var/www/moodle/auth/ldap/cli/sync_users.php
 *
 * Notes:
 *   - it is required to use the web server account when executing PHP CLI scripts
 *   - you need to change the "www-data" to match the apache user account
 *   - use "su" if "sudo" not available
 *   - If you have a large number of users, you may want to raise the memory limits
 *     by passing -d momory_limit=256M
 *   - For debugging & better logging, you are encouraged to use in the command line:
 *     -d log_errors=1 -d error_reporting=E_ALL -d display_errors=0 -d html_errors=0
 *   - If you have a large number of users, you may want to raise the memory limits
 *     by passing -d momory_limit=256M
 *   - For debugging & better logging, you are encouraged to use in the command line:
 *     -d log_errors=1 -d error_reporting=E_ALL -d display_errors=0 -d html_errors=0
 *
 * Performance notes:
 * We have optimized it as best as we could for PostgreSQL and MySQL, with 27K students
 * we have seen this take 10 minutes.
