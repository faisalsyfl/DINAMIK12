=== 2.6 ===

* can_be_manually_set() - This function was introduced in the base class and returns false by default. If overriden by
  an authentication plugin to return true, the authentication plugin will be able to be manually set for users. For example,
  when bulk uploading users you will be able to select it as the authentication method they use.

required changes in code:
* use role_get_name() or role_fix_names() if you need any role names, using role.name
  directly from database is not correct any more

optional - no changes needed:
* add support for custom user signup form - see auth_plugin_base::signup_form() function

=== 2.2 ===

required changes in code:
* the correct sequence to set up global $USER is:
    $user = get_complete_user_data('username', $username); // or $user = authenticate_user_login()
    enrol_check_plugins($user);
    session_set_user($user);
