------------------------
Moodle Trademark License
------------------------

The name Moodle™ is a registered trademark of the Moodle Trust.

A key part of the business model that allows us to produce and
distribute Moodle as completely Free open source software is that
we restrict the commercial use of the Moodle trademark to those
who have contracted to support Moodle development (Moodle Partners).

If you are intending to use the name (and/or logo) to advertise
generic Moodle™ services (eg Moodle Hosting, Moodle Support,
Moodle Certification, Moodle Training, Moodle Consulting,
Moodle Customisation, Moodle Courseware Development, Moodle
Theme design, Moodle Integrations, Moodle Installations, etc)
or as the name of a software package, then you must seek
direct permission in writing from the Moodle Trust via the
moodle.com helpdesk, in accordance with normal trademark
restrictions.

There are no restrictions on how you use the name in other
contexts (for example, if you use Moodle just to provide
courses then you can use the name freely to refer to it.)

If you aren't sure of a particular case, please ask us via
http://moodle.com/helpdesk: we'll be happy to either provide
you with official permission in writing or help you fix
your wording.
