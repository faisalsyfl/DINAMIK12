Google APIs Client Library for PHP
==================================

Only the source and the README files have been kept in this directory.

The configuration (local_config.php) of this API specifies a different ioClass
than the default one. This new ioClass has been defined in curlio.php and is
named moodle_google_curlio, extending Google_CurlIO. The only reason to do
that was that we could force Google lib to use our implementation of curl.
If you upgrade the library, please check if the method Google_CurlIO::makeRequest()
has been updated and would require change in moodle_google_curlio.

Library hack
------------

* The file Google_Client.php resets the timezone to UTC. The line
  date_default_timezone_set('UTC'); should be commented out. See MDL-42808.
