Feature: People Block used on frontpage
  In order to view participants in a site
  As a admin
  I can add the people block to the front page

      | username    | firstname | lastname | email            |
      | student1    | Sam       | Student  | student1@asd.com |
    And I log in as "admin"
    And I follow "Turn editing on"
    And I add the "People" block
    And I log out

  Scenario: Admin can view site participants link
    When I log in as "admin"
    Then "People" "block" should exist
