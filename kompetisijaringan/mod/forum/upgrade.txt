This files describes API changes in /mod/forum/*,
information provided here is intended especially for developers.

=== 2.6 ===

* The file post_form.php should not be included, the class it contained has
  been moved so that it can benefit from autoloading.
* The function forum_shorten_post() has been deprecated. It was doing a poor
  job of shortening forum post text and the shorten_text() function does a
  much better job.
* The constant FORUM_TRACKING_ON has been depreciated and replaced by
  FORUM_TRACKING_FORCED. The value between them is maintained, so they are
  interchangeable, but code should migrate to the new name.

=== 2.5 ===

The function forum_check_throttling has been changed so that a warning object is returned when a user has reached the 'Post threshold for warning' or
'Post threshold for blocking' setting, rather than echoing this on screen. This allows the warning to be moved inside the post form as it can be added
as a HTML element, where it is more noticeable. False is returned if there is no need to warn, or restrict the user from posting - see MDL-39182.

=== 2.3.5, 2.4.2 ===

* mod/forum:allowforcesubscribe capability will be forcefully assigned to frontpage role, as it was mistakenly missed off
when the capability was initially created. If you don't want users with frontpage role to get forum (with forcesubscribe) emails,
then please remove this capability for frontpage role.
