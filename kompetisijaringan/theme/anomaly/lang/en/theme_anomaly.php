If you want to modify this theme, we recommend that you first duplicate it, then rename it before making your changes. This will prevent your customized theme from being overwritten by future Moodle upgrades, and you\'ll still have the original files if you make a mess. More information on modifying themes can be found in the <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Theme">MoodleDocs</a>.</p><h2>Credits</h2><p>This theme was originally designed for Moodle 1.9 by Patrick Malley. It was then coded for 2.0 and is maintained by Sam Hemelryk at Moodle HQ. He can be contacted at sam@moodle.com.</p><h2>License</h2><p>This, and all other themes included in the Moodle core, are licensed under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU General Public License</a>.</div></div>';
