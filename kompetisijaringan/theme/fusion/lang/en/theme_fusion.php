		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>Fusion is a two-column, fluid-width theme coded for Moodle 2.0. It makes use of custom menus that appear above the site title on every page. It also includes a basic settings page allowing you to change link color, add a tagline above the site name on the front page, and add text to the footer.</p>

		<h2>Parents</h2>
		<p>This theme is built upon both Base and Canvas, two parent themes included in the Moodle core. If you wish to modify aspects of this theme beyond the settings offered, we advise creating a new  theme using this theme, Base and Canvas all as parents so updates to any of those themes in the core will find their way into your new theme.</p>

		<h2>Credits</h2>
