AMFTester.mxml can be compiled as a Flex application in Flex builder or using the Flex SDK.

Copy the following into a Flex project source folder :

* customValidators folder and contents
* AMFTester.mxml

Then you need to use either the compiled Flex library or the source for the open source library as3corelib available here : http://code.google.com/p/as3corelib/downloads/list
