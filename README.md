The system panel includes account management, event management (enable/disable registration for each event), event participants management, payment confirmation, news management, sponsor lists (unused on home page), and bazaar tenant registration (unused on home page).

For school/competition participant's account, they can register themselves to the competition which still opened its registration, and upload their registration fee payment to be approved by the admin/the event's treasurer.

For the public account, they can register as a participant in the publicly-available event (ie. talkshow/seminar), and there is a 'point' system which uses a code from the event's tenant (during the event), and the user can redeem it on the DINAMIK12 stall for the official merchandise.
